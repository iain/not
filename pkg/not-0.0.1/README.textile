h1. Not

This little gem adds a little syntactic sugar to your code. You can append not
in the middle of your code to improve readability.

h2. Examples

  @foo.not.nil?
  @user.not.active?
  "something".not.tainted?
  User.not.new(:name => 'iain') # not sure why you'd want to do this though
  @foo.not.not.not.not.send(:not).not.nil? # sorry, couldn't resist
